# üß∞ Python Module Attribute & Method Logger

This Python script dynamically imports one or more Python modules (built-in or third-party), lists all their attributes and methods, and logs them to a file with timestamped filenames.

Each module's log file is saved in the **same directory where the script is executed**, including classification of each item as a **function** or an **attribute**.

## üì¶ Features

- Accepts **multiple module names** (e.g., `math os sys`).
- Logs the **name, type (method/attribute)** of each item in the module.
- Each module generates its own log file.
- Logs are timestamped with local time and time zone.
- Custom logging format with severity levels: INFO, ERROR, SUCCESS.
