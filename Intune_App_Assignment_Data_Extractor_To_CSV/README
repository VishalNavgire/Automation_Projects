🔍 Overview
Managing app assignments in Microsoft Intune can be tedious—especially when dealing with hundreds or thousands of apps. 
This PowerShell script automates the process by retrieving assignment details for all Intune apps and exporting them into a structured CSV file. No more clicking through each app manually! 🙌

⚙️ Prerequisites
PowerShell 5.1 or later
Admin permissions to access Intune and Entra ID data.

🚀 How to Use
Open PowerShell as Administrator.
Run the script.
Authenticate when prompted.
Wait for the script to complete.
Find the CSV file in the output directory.

📂 Output
The script generates a CSV file with the following columns:
Column Name	Description
App_Name	Name of the Intune app
App_Type	Type of the app (e.g., Win32, iOS, Android)
App_Version	Version of the app
App_Id	Unique identifier of the app
App_LastUpdatedOn	Last modified date of the app
MsEntra_Group_Name	Name of the Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) group assigned
MsEntra_Group_ID	Object ID of the group
App_Intent	Assignment intent (e.g., Required, Available, Uninstall)

🛡️ Notes
The script uses Microsoft Graph API to fetch data.
Ensure you have the necessary API permissions (e.g., DeviceManagementApps.Read.All, Group.Read.All).
Large environments may take a few minutes to process.
